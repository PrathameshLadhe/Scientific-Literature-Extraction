# Scientific-Literature-Extraction
#### Summer Research Project | May 2024 - July 2024

Built a system to automatically collect and analyze research papers, focusing on finding useful graphs and classifying articles.

### Article Collection & Classification
- Collected over **5,000** research articles using web scraping tools.
- Organized articles based on **keywords** and whether they included graphs.
- Used **machine learning** to automatically pull out text and images from the articles.

### Graph Detection & Analysis
- Used **Pytesseract** to read text from images.
- Applied the **YOLOv8** model to find and recognize graphs in the papers.
- Reached **95% accuracy** for finding graphs, **90% for X-axis labels**, and **94% for Y-axis labels**.
- The model had a strong **F1 score of 0.86** for graph classification.

### Real-World Use
- Analyzed **Shape Memory Alloy (SMA)** papers and found **580** with useful stress-strain graphs out of 5,000+.

###  Tools & Technologies
**Python**, **Machine Learning**, **YOLOv8**, **Pytesseract**, **Web Scraping**, **Image Processing**
